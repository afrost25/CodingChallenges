# Grokking Coding Interview Learning

## What This is For

I am using this repository to keep a track record of previous problems I have worked on and to keep a history
of my learning process in recognizing problem patterns. I wanted to keep a record of my solutions to problems, thoughts
and then actual solutions with my own notes to analyze and understand. The goal is to see progress overtime and growth 
on recognizing patterns and implementing them.

## How This Repository is Organized
- For each problem, I upload my own solution(s) reflecting my initial approach.
- I also include adapted or reference solutions from sources like Grokking, often with added comments or modifications 
to help me out with understanding the code and logic
- Each solution is accompanied by my notes or reflections on what I learned, differences in approach, and insight gained.
